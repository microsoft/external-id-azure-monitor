- Read about [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) to understand its key features.

- Read about [Azure Active Directory reporting latencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-latencies) and [Log data ingestion time in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-ingestion-time) which covers various latencies across Azure External ID and Azure Monitor.

- Read about [Log Analytics Queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal) to understand how to create and run reports using [Kusto](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/concepts/) language.

- Read about [Azure Monitor Workbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/workbooks-overview) which provides a flexible canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports.

- Read about [Azure Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview) their benefits and usage patterns.

## Prerequisites

- You will be required to create an Azure External ID directory, see the guidance [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/quickstart-tenant-setup).

- Setup Azure Monitor to route sign-in and auditing logs to Log Analytics workspace. After the setup is complete, it may take up to 45 minutes or so for logs to show up in Log Analytics workspace. Subsequently, Azure monitor will sync the logs within few minutes as they get generated by Azure External ID.
